** 1. Project Overview**
The Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty Analytics Dashboard was designed to uncover insights into what drives customer satisfaction, loyalty, and repeat purchasing behavior.
In a competitive market, understanding the why behind customer attitudes is crucial. This dashboard serves as a data-driven decision-support tool, helping businesses identify:
•	Which factors contribute most to customer happiness
•	How loyalty levels vary across demographics and regions
•	Whether contact with support teams impacts satisfaction
•	The behavioral differences between one-time and repeat buyers
By visualizing and analyzing these patterns, this project bridges the gap between raw feedback data and strategic customer experience management.
