# OMNI RETAIL ANALYSIS
**1.Project Overview**

The Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty Analytics Dashboard was designed to uncover insights into what drives customer satisfaction, loyalty, and repeat purchasing behavior.
In a competitive market, understanding the why behind customer attitudes is crucial. This dashboard serves as a data-driven decision-support tool, helping businesses identify:
•	Which factors contribute most to customer happiness
•	How loyalty levels vary across demographics and regions
•	Whether contact with support teams impacts satisfaction
•	The behavioral differences between one-time and repeat buyers
By visualizing and analyzing these patterns, this project bridges the gap between raw feedback data and strategic customer experience management.

**2.Project Scope**

**The project aimed to:**
* Analyze and visualize customer satisfaction and loyalty patterns
* Measure the impact of key factors such as support interaction, purchase history, and demographics
* Identify regional and segment-based differences
* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to enable data exploration by stakeholders
Core questions addressed:
1.	What factors contribute to high or low satisfaction scores?
2.	Are certain customer segments more loyal than others?
3.	How does customer support interaction affect satisfaction?
4.	Do repeat buyers show higher satisfaction than one-time buyers?
5.	Which regions report the most loyal or dissatisfied customers?

**3.Methodology**

**A structured data analytics life cycle was followed:**

**Step 1: Data Collection & Cleaning**

* Imported the dataset into Power BI and reviewed for missing values or inconsistencies.
* Cleaned data fields for clarity (e.g., separating Location into City and State).
* Verified numeric formats for satisfaction scores, age, and geolocation.

**Step 2: Data Modeling**

* Created relationships between fields where necessary.
* Added calculated columns:
o	Age_Group (using DAX to categorize ages into 18–25, 26–40, 41–60, 60+)
o	Numeric loyalty levels for easier analysis.
* Built DAX measures for KPIs such as average satisfaction, high loyalty percentage, and support contact rate.

**Step 3: Visualization**

Designed a multi-section dashboard combining KPIs, demographic visuals, behavioral analysis, and geographical insights.
Used slicers and interactive filters (Location, Age, Satisfaction Factor) for flexible exploration.

**Step 4: Analysis & Insight Extraction**

* Interpreted trends and patterns using descriptive analytics and comparative visual storytelling.
* Highlighted actionable insights for business decision-making.

**4.Data Source**

* Dataset: DataDNA Dataset Challenge - Customer Satisfaction Data
* Records: 120 customers
* Fields included:
o	Demographics: Age, Gender, Location (City/State)
o	Behavioral: Purchase History, Support Contacted
o	Attitudinal: Satisfaction Score, Loyalty Level, Satisfaction Factors
o	Geographic: Latitude & Longitude

**5.Tools Used**

**Tool and	Purpose**

Microsoft Power BI Desktop	Main platform for data visualization and dashboard creation
Microsoft Excel	Initial data review, cleaning, and transformation
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)	Used for calculated KPIs, measures, and dynamic insights
Power Query Editor	Data shaping and preprocessing
Map Visuals (ArcGIS / Filled Map)	Regional satisfaction mapping

**6.Results and Key Findings (with KPIs)**

**Key KPIs Developed**

* Average Satisfaction Rate with Dax Measure of 5.35 and value insight of overall satisfaction level
* High Loyalty level of 31% and value insight of Share of customers marked as highly loyal
* Support Contact Rate of 47%	and value insight of Proportion of customers who reached support
* Total Customers	120	Size of customer dataset
* High Satisfaction % (≥8)	~25%	Customers with strong satisfaction ratings
* Repeat Buyers %	~57%	Customers with multiple purchases

**Analytical Insights**

**1.	Loyalty and Satisfaction Correlation:**
Customers with high loyalty scores had average satisfaction ratings above 5.8, confirming that loyalty strongly aligns with customer happiness.

**2.	Top Drivers of Satisfaction:**
o	Product Quality (7.5)
o	Packaging (7.0)
o	Product Variety (6.1)
These emerged as major factors influencing satisfaction, while Ease of Use and Features ranked lowest.

**3.	Impact of Support Interaction:**
Contacting customer support had a neutral effect on satisfaction — indicating that support teams are resolving issues efficiently without reducing confidence.

**4.	Repeat vs One-Time Buyers:**
Repeat buyers had an average satisfaction score of 5.6, slightly higher than one-time buyers at 5.0, implying positive post-purchase experiences.

**5.	Demographic and Regional Patterns:**
o	Males showed slightly higher loyalty averages compared to females.
o	Mid-age segments (26–40, 41–60) displayed stronger loyalty and satisfaction levels.
o	Chicago, Phoenix, and San Diego topped satisfaction rankings, while Los Angeles and Austin showed room for improvement.

**6.	Group-Level Insight:**
Group “B” recorded more customers with higher satisfaction and loyalty scores compared to Group “A”.

**7.Recommendations**

**1.	Enhance Low-Performing Factors:**
Focus on improving “Ease of Use” and “Features” since these had the lowest satisfaction impact.

**2.	Customer Retention Strategy:**
Leverage insights from repeat buyers to design loyalty programs targeting one-time buyers.

**3.	Regional Targeting:**
Investigate practices in top-performing cities (Chicago, Phoenix) and replicate success strategies in low-satisfaction areas.

**4.	Customer Support Optimization:**
Continue investing in support quality — it currently sustains satisfaction even post-issue, which is a competitive strength.

**5.	Demographic Segmentation:**
Tailor marketing and retention strategies by age group and gender to maximize engagement from loyal segments.

**8.Conclusion**

This Power BI project demonstrates how data analytics transforms customer data into strategic intelligence.
By integrating customer feedback, behavioral data, and geographic trends, the dashboard provides a holistic view of customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Key takeaway:**

“Customer loyalty is not random — it’s data-driven.”
Businesses that consistently track, analyze, and act on customer satisfaction metrics will retain more customers, improve product quality, and create long-term brand advocates.

**9.Additional Highlights**

* Fully interactive dashboard with drill-through and slicers.
* Consistent visual theme using dual-tone color coding (brown for loyalty, blue for satisfaction).
* Designed for executive-level storytelling with intuitive KPIs and regional context.

**10.Project Impact**

**This project showcases:**

* Analytical thinking — identifying business patterns through data
* Technical expertise — Power BI, DAX, and data visualization
* Business acumen — transforming data into actionable recommendations
